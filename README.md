# ESA Listings Summary

A small app to get an overview of species listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA).

## Version 2

This is an `R` [flexdashboard](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) version of an [earlier](https://github.com/mjevans26/esasummary) [Shiny app](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).

## Why

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) provides basic information about ESA-listed species on their [ECOS website](http://ecos.fws.gov). But finding the right information is challenging and there is no visual representation (e.g., graphs and maps). This app addresses some of those issues.
